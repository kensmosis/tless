NAME
    tless - Quick Viewer for text files of tabular data

SYNOPSIS
    tless [-f inputfile] [options] [-X "Key Commands"]

DESCRIPTION
    Tless is a utility to quickly view tabular text data. It was inspired by
    'less' and acts in a similar capacity for tables. To this end, it offers
    several essential features.

    Columns: Tless is aware of the concept of a table "column" and operates
    in two dimensions instead of just one. Accordingly, it allows convenient
    movement and searches using both rows and columns.

    Parsing: Rows are parsed on the fly in a customizable manner. The input
    may be delimited, fixed width, or csv.

    Synchronized Scrolling: Rows and columns may be frozen and unfrozen
    dynamically. Tless performs synchronized scrolling with these (frozen
    columns only scroll vertically and frozen rows only scroll
    horizontally). This allows a user to scan through a large file of data,
    both horizontally and vertically, without losing sight of any header
    rows or index columns. Because the frozen rows and columns need not be
    consecutive, Tless offers more flexibility than a typical split-screen
    application.

    Lightweight: Tless examines a file locally and uses a caching mechanism.
    Like 'less', it can be used to view very large files (in both
    directions) with minimal start-up time, performance loss, or memory
    foot-print. It uses curses and is a terminal application for both
    portability and speed.


    Note that tless is a viewing utility. Although it provides basic search
    functionality, it is not a spreadsheet or database and allows no
    editing, calculation, or DB style queries. It can be thought of as a
    lightweight two dimensional data viewer.

SCREEN LAYOUT
    The screen is broken into several portions, some of which may not be
    visible at any given time.

    Row Index: The leftmost column displays the row number in the file. This
    may be turned on or off dynamically.
    Frozen Columns: Next from the left are any frozen columns in the order
    in which they were frozen by the user. These only scroll vertically and
    may be added or removed dynamically.
    Column Index: The topmost row displays the column numbers. This may be
    turned on or off dynamically.
    Frozen Rows: Next down are any frozen rows in the order in which they
    were frozen by the user. These only scroll horizontally and may be added
    or removed dynamically.
    Message Line: The bottom row is for commands and messages.
    Active Region: The remainder of the columns and rows are "active" and
    scroll both horizontally and vertically. This is a window into the file.
    Frozen Cells: Note that in the upper left region, if both rows and
    columns are frozen there will be an overlap which doesn't scroll in
    either direction.

OPTIONS
    Note that in some cases the order of options makes a difference. In
    particular, any default justification should be set before fixed columns
    are specified. Also, some options only are valid in the context of
    others. Sometimes invalid options are ignored, but if ambiguous or
    indicative of user error they may cause the program to exit.

  General
    -h --help
         Display usage information.

    -v --version
         Display version number.

    -f --file filename
         Specify an input file. At this time, reading from stdin is not
         supported.

    -z --cache n
         Specify a cache size. The maximal cache size will be 3x this
         because front and end caches are also used. DEFAULT=10000.

    -X --exec "cmds"
         Execute a series of key commands once initialized. The commands are
         space delimited and each has either the form 'c' or 'c:arg:arg:...'
         where c is the key for the command and any arguments are those that
         would be typed after them.

  Parsing
    Only one of --delim, --sdelim, --csv, or --fixed may be used.

    WARNING: If escaped chars like \t appear in the argument to --delim or
    --sdelim then one must be wary of the shell. For example, in bash one
    could write --sdelim $'\t ' to delimit with tab and space. It is best to
    use the -t option to avoid shell issues and promote portability.

    -d --delim string
    -s --sdelim string
         The file will be parsed using the specified characters as
         delimiters. With --delim adjacent delimiters are merged, while with
         --sdelim they are not. DEFAULT= --delim with tab and space.

    -t   Add a tab to the delimiter string. Some shells make it challenging
         to pass a tab to the program. If that is the case, this may be used
         instead. If -d or -s is used as well, tab is added as a delimiter
         to the existing choices. If not, then -d is implied. To parse only
         with single tabs, use -s '' -t or something similar. The -t option
         must follow any -d or -s options.

    -c --csv
         The file will be parsed according to the csv specification. NOTE:
         At present, this is a simplified parser. It allows quoted or
         non-quoted fields and can accommodate embedded ,'s inside of quoted
         fields -- but nothing more complex than this.

    -x --fixed wid1:wid2:wid3:...
         The file will be parsed using the specified fixed column widths.

    -l --ignoreleading on/off
         Ignore leading delimiters. This eliminates misalignments due to
         some rows starting on a delimiter and some not. DEFAULT=on.

    -e --eol char
         Use the specified character as the end of line marker in the file.
         If unset, then any of \n, \r, or \r\n will match. Note that null
         always matches and that adjacent eols (except \r\n) yield separate
         lines and are not merged.

    -M --maxcols n
         Specify a maximum number of columns to parse and display. Any
         additional columns are ignored.

    -Q --removequotes
         Strip outer double-quotes ("") if they are present for each field.
         The quotes are only stripped from a field if they appear as a pair.
         Note that this is automatic with --csv.

    -k --skip n
         Skip the first n rows of the file for all purposes.

    -m --allowexpansion
         Allow the file to expand while in use. The reason this must be
         specified is that a file without a terminal eol would lose the last
         line if we allow expansion (because we must hold off processing any
         line without an eol until it is complete).

  Display
    -a --aligntofirst
         Use the specified delimiters to set the column widths to those in
         the first row (or first non-skipped row). Not for use with --fixed.
         Note that this may lead to visually unappealing results if the
         first row is a header with headings that are smaller than the data
         entries below them. This may be corrected using the key commands
         "+", "-","(",")", and "W" as appropriate.

    -w --defwidth n
         Set the column width for all columns to n. DEFAULT=12.

    -G --grid [c]
         Toggle display separators between columns. The default is ON with
         '|' as the separator. If 'c' is specified, use that character as
         the separator and keep the grid on. Otherwise, turn it off. Note
         that the grid may be turned on and off dynamically as well (see key
         command "x").

    -S --seps [c]
         Toggle display separators between the frozen rows/cols and the
         active portion of the screen. The default is ON with '#' as the
         separator. If 'c' is specified, use that character as the separator
         and keep it on. Otherwise, turn it off. The separators may be
         toggled on and off dynamically as well (see key command "z").

    -R --rowindex on/off/n
         Activate or deactivate the leftmost column, which is a row index.
         If the argument is a number instead of on/off, use that as the
         width. Otherwise, the default width is 6 characters (followed by a
         space). This may be toggled on and off dynamically using the "P"
         key command. DEFAULT= 6 (on).

    -C --colindex on/off
         Activate or deactivate the topmost row, which is a column index.
         This may be toggled on and off dynamically using the "V" key
         command. DEFAULT=on.

    -j --justify right/left
         Set the default justification for all columns. This may be changed
         dynamically using the "^","$","[", and "]" key commands.
         DEFAULT=right.

    -F --filler char
         Specify a filler character for any empty space on the screen.
         DEFAULT= " " (white space).

KEYBOARD COMMANDS
    The following keys perform actions while running. Those with [foo] after
    them indicate a required argument (as opposed to the option section
    where it indicated an optional argument). This is input on the command
    line (the bottom line of the terminal) followed by enter. Note that the
    number of columns may grow if the document width changes). The movement
    commands only affect the active region.

    Searches may either be ordinary (simple text matching) or regexps. The
    type is autodetected depending on whether the string is surround by a //
    pair. Note that for searches, the matching text may not be visible on
    the screen if the cell is too narrow to display it. Using the 'v'
    command should provide full visibility where necessary. Regardless, the
    matching cell row and col are displayed in the message bar. Also note
    that regexps are compared per cell. That is, the cell itself is viewed
    as a 'line' rather than the row as a whole. Typically, the active window
    aligns to the next search result in the upper left corner. However, it
    may not do so (or appear to do so) if the result appears in the frozen
    part of the screen or too few rows or columns remain to fill the screen.
    Hidden columns are not searched.

    h Print usage information and exit.
    l,r Move left or right one column.
    a,e Move to the far left or right.
    <,> Move to the left or right one screen.
    y,k Move up one line.
    j,ret Move down one line.
    b,u Move up one screen.
    f,d,spc Move down one screen.
    g,G Move to the top or bottom of the document (note that G may take a
    while for a large file).
    C [n] Toggle whether column n is frozen. Frozen columns appear on the
    left in the order in which they were frozen.
    C [.] Unfreeze all columns.
    C [n] Toggle whether row n is frozen. Row n must be visible (or in the
    cache) in order to freeze it (but any frozen row may be unfrozen).
    Frozen rows appear on the top in the order in which they were frozen.
    R [.] Unfreeze all rows.
    s or / [foo] Row-wise search. Places top-left corner at search result
    and displays the result on the message line. The search is forward and
    down from the upper left active cell (or the previous result). If foo is
    of the form /bar/ then it is interpreted as a regexp. Otherwise it is
    treated like an ordinary string to match. Note that the / used to
    inaugurate the command is independent of the / that starts a regexp; in
    other words, / must be hit twice to start a regexp.
    S or ? [foo] Column-wise search. Places top-left corner at search result
    and displays the result on the message line. The search is down and
    forward from the upper left active cell (or the previous result). If foo
    is of the form /bar/ then it is interpreted as a regexp. Otherwise it is
    treated like an ordinary string to match.
    n,p Next, previous search result for last search. "p" may also be used
    to search backwards.
    v [row:col] Display the contents of the specified cell (on screen) in
    the message area. Useful when a cell is too small to fully display its
    contents.
    H [n] Toggle hidden status of column n. Hidden columns are not shown or
    searched and may or may not be frozen.
    H [.] Unhide all columns.
    + [n] Expand width of column n by 1.
    - [n] Shrink width of column n by 1. The width cannot drop below 1 (to
    hide the column, use 'H').
    + [.] Expand width of all columns by 1.
    - [.] Shrink width of all columns by 1. The width of any column cannot
    drop below 1.
    ) Expand width of all columns by 1 (same as "+ .")
    ( Shrink width of all columns by 1 (same as "- .")
    W [n:w] Specify width of column n as w.
    W [.:w] Specify width of all columns as w.
    W [w] Specify width of all columns as w (same as "W .:w")
    m [c] Mark position and label it with letter c.
    ' [c] Return to the position labelled with letter c.
    ^ [n] Justify column n to left.
    $ [n] Justify column n to right.
    ^ [.] Justify all columns to left.
    $ [.] Justify all columns to right.
    [ Justify all columns to left (same as "^ .")
    ] Justify all columns to right (same as "$ .")
    x Toggle grid.
    z Toggle frozen section separators.
    P Toggle row index column.
    V Toggle column index row.
    L [row:col] Move the upper left corner of the active region to the
    specified row and column. If they are frozen or hidden, find a nearby
    substitute.
    q Quit.
    Y Resize the screen to fit the terminal. This should be done
    automatically when the terminal is resized, but a command is provided in
    case a manual repaint is needed.
    F Clear EOF info so that new lines added afterward can be read.

    Note that the G and S commands necessarily involve a seek to the end of
    the file and will be expensive for large files. Also, the commands s, n,
    p, and L may prove expensive depending on the details of the file and
    request.

    Parse left-justified fixed-width columns: tless -f foo.txt -j left
    -x:10:10:15:8:15:6

    Parse ':' separated columns that are all the same width: tless -f
    foo.txt -d ":" -w 15

    A simple setup tless -f foo.txt -X "C:0 R:0 L:24:10"

EXIT STATUS
    tless returns a zero exit status. It restores the terminal on exit.
