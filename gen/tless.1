.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Tless is a utility to quickly view tabular text data.  It was inspired by 'less' and acts in a similar capacity for tables.  To this end, it offers several essential features.
.ie n .IP "\fBColumns\fR: Tless is aware of the concept of a table ""column"" and operates in two dimensions instead of just one.  Accordingly, it allows convenient movement and searches using both rows and columns." 5

.IP "\fBSynchronized Scrolling\fR: Rows and columns may be frozen and unfrozen dynamically.  Tless performs synchronized scrolling with these (frozen columns only scroll vertically and frozen rows only scroll horizontally).  This allows a user to scan through a large file of data, both horizontally and vertically, without losing sight of any header rows or index columns.  Because the frozen rows and columns need not be consecutive, Tless offers more flexibility than a typical split-screen application." 5

Note that tless is a viewing utility. Although it provides basic search functionality, it is not a spreadsheet or database and allows no editing, calculation, or \s-1DB\s0 style queries.  It can be thought of as a lightweight two dimensional data viewer.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Note that in some cases the order of options makes a difference.  In particular, any default justification should be set before fixed columns are specified.  Also, some options only are valid in the context of others.  Sometimes invalid options are ignored, but if ambiguous or indicative of user error they may cause the program to exit.
.SS "General"
.IX Subsection "General"
.IP "\fB\-h  \-\-help\fR" 5
.IX Item "-h --help"
Display usage information.
.IP "\fB\-v  \-\-version\fR" 5
.IX Item "-v --version"
Display version number.
.IP "\fB\-f  \-\-file filename\fR" 5
.IX Item "-f --file filename"
Specify an input file.  At this time, reading from stdin is not supported.
.IP "\fB\-z  \-\-cache n\fR" 5
.IX Item "-z --cache n"
Specify a cache size.  The maximal cache size will be 3x this because front and end caches are also used. DEFAULT=10000.
.ie n .IP "\fB\-X  \-\-exec ""cmds""\fR" 5
.el .IP "\fB\-X  \-\-exec ``cmds''\fR" 5
.IX Item "-X --exec cmds"
Execute a series of key commands once initialized.  The commands are space delimited and each has either the form 'c' or 'c:arg:arg:...' where c is the key for the command and any arguments are those that would be typed after them.
.SS "Parsing"
.IX Subsection "Parsing"
Only one of \-\-delim, \-\-sdelim, \-\-csv, or \-\-fixed may be used.
.PP
\&\s-1WARNING:\s0  If escaped chars like \et appear in the argument to \-\-delim or \-\-sdelim then one must be wary of the shell.  For example, in bash one could write  \-\-sdelim $'\et ' to delimit with tab and space.  It is best to use the \-t option to avoid shell issues and promote portability.
.IP "\fB\-d  \-\-delim string\fR" 5
.IX Item "-d --delim string"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-s  \-\-sdelim string\fR" 5
.IX Item "-s --sdelim string"
.PD
The file will be parsed using the specified characters as delimiters.  With \-\-delim adjacent delimiters are merged, while with \-\-sdelim they are not.    DEFAULT=  \-\-delim with tab and space.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 5
.IX Item "-t"
Add a tab to the delimiter string.  Some shells make it challenging to pass a tab to the program.  If that is the case, this may be used instead.  If \-d or \-s is used as well, tab is added as a delimiter to the existing choices.  If not, then \-d is implied.  To parse only with single tabs, use  \-s '' \-t or something similar.  The \-t option must follow any \-d or \-s options.
.IP "\fB\-c  \-\-csv\fR" 5
.IX Item "-c --csv"
The file will be parsed according to the csv specification.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 At present, this is a simplified parser.  It allows quoted or non-quoted fields and can accommodate embedded ,'s inside of quoted fields \*(-- but nothing more complex than this.
.IP "\fB\-x  \-\-fixed wid1:wid2:wid3:...\fR" 5
.IX Item "-x --fixed wid1:wid2:wid3:..."
The file will be parsed using the specified fixed column widths.
.IP "\fB\-l  \-\-ignoreleading on/off\fR" 5
.IX Item "-l --ignoreleading on/off"
Ignore leading delimiters.  This eliminates misalignments due to some rows starting on a delimiter and some not.  DEFAULT=on.
.IP "\fB\-e  \-\-eol char\fR" 5
.IX Item "-e --eol char"
Use the specified character as the end of line marker in the file.  If unset, then any of \en, \er, or \er\en will match.  Note that null always matches and that adjacent eols (except \er\en) yield separate lines and are not merged.
.IP "\fB\-M  \-\-maxcols n\fR" 5
.IX Item "-M --maxcols n"
Specify a maximum number of columns to parse and display.  Any additional columns are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-Q  \-\-removequotes\fR" 5
.IX Item "-Q --removequotes"
Strip outer double-quotes ("") if they are present for each field.  The quotes are only stripped from a field if they appear as a pair.  Note that this is automatic with \-\-csv.
.IP "\fB\-k  \-\-skip n\fR" 5
.IX Item "-k --skip n"
Skip the first n rows of the file for all purposes.
.IP "\fB\-m  \-\-allowexpansion\fR" 5
.IX Item "-m --allowexpansion"
Allow the file to expand while in use.  The reason this must be specified is that a file without a terminal eol would lose the last line if we allow expansion (because we must hold off processing any line without an eol until it is complete).
.SS "Display"
.IX Subsection "Display"
.IP "\fB\-a  \-\-aligntofirst\fR" 5
.IX Item "-a --aligntofirst"
Use the specified delimiters to set the column widths to those in the first row (or first non-skipped row). Not for use with \-\-fixed.  Note that this may lead to visually unappealing results if the first row is a header with headings that are smaller than the data entries below them.  This may be corrected using the key commands \*(L"+\*(R", \*(L"\-\*(R",\*(L"(\*(R",\*(L")\*(R", and \*(L"W\*(R" as appropriate.
.IP "\fB\-w  \-\-defwidth n\fR" 5
.IX Item "-w --defwidth n"
Set the column width for all columns to n.  DEFAULT=12.
.IP "\fB\-G  \-\-grid [c]\fR" 5
.IX Item "-G --grid [c]"
Toggle display separators between columns.  The default is \s-1ON\s0 with '|' as the separator.  If 'c' is specified, use that character as the separator and keep the grid on.   Otherwise, turn it off. Note that the grid may be turned on and off dynamically as well (see key command \*(L"x\*(R").
.IP "\fB\-S  \-\-seps [c]\fR" 5
.IX Item "-S --seps [c]"
Toggle display separators between the frozen rows/cols and the active portion of the screen.  The default is \s-1ON\s0 with '#' as the separator. If 'c' is specified, use that character as the separator and keep it on.  Otherwise, turn it off. The separators may be toggled on and off dynamically as well (see key command \*(L"z\*(R").
.IP "\fB\-R  \-\-rowindex on/off/n\fR" 5
.IX Item "-R --rowindex on/off/n"
Activate or deactivate the leftmost column, which is a row index.  If the argument is a number instead of on/off, use that as the width.  Otherwise, the default width is 6 characters (followed by a space).  This may be toggled on and off dynamically using the \*(L"P\*(R" key command.  DEFAULT= 6 (on).
.IP "\fB\-C  \-\-colindex on/off\fR" 5
.IX Item "-C --colindex on/off"
Activate or deactivate the topmost row, which is a column index.  This may be toggled on and off dynamically using the \*(L"V\*(R" key command.  DEFAULT=on.
.IP "\fB\-j  \-\-justify right/left\fR" 5
.IX Item "-j --justify right/left"
Set the default justification for all columns.  This may be changed dynamically using the \*(L"^\*(R",\*(L"$\*(R",\*(L"[\*(R", and \*(L"]\*(R" key commands.  DEFAULT=right.
.IP "\fB\-F  \-\-filler char\fR" 5
.IX Item "-F --filler char"
Specify a filler character for any empty space on the screen.  DEFAULT= \*(L" \*(R" (white space).
.SH "KEYBOARD COMMANDS"
.IX Header "KEYBOARD COMMANDS"
The following keys perform actions while running.  Those with [foo] after them indicate a required argument (as opposed to the option section where it indicated an optional argument).  This is input on the command line (the bottom line of the terminal) followed by enter.  Note that the number of columns may grow if the document width changes).  The movement commands only affect the active region.
.PP
Searches may either be ordinary (simple text matching) or regexps.  The type is autodetected depending on whether the string is surround by a // pair.   Note that for searches, the matching text may not be visible on the screen if the cell is too narrow to display it.  Using the 'v' command should provide full visibility where necessary.  Regardless, the matching cell row and col are displayed in the message bar.  Also note that regexps are compared per cell.  That is, the cell itself is viewed as a 'line' rather than the row as a whole.  Typically, the active window aligns to the next search result in the upper left corner.  However, it may not do so (or appear to do so) if the result appears in the frozen part of the screen or too few rows or columns remain to fill the screen.  Hidden columns are not searched.
